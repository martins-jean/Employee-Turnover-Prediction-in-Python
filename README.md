# Employee turnover prediction in python

## Contextual overview

<p align="justify">
Employee turnover represents a major burden for companies because it leads to direct costs in the form of hiring costs, training costs, productivity loss, opportunity costs for accounts left unmanaged as well as indirect costs such as the loss of institutional knowledge and the impact on employee morale. <br> <br>

This is the first of a series of projects on workforce analytics. Given the importance of turnover, I decided to explore that topic twice (in python and in R) thereby using different datasets, models and perspectives.

## Project objectives

<p align="justify">
1. Describe and visualize the key variables and prepare the dataset for analytics. <br>
2. Develop a decision tree classifier model. <br>
3. Use cross-validation and dimensionality reduction to avoid overfitting the training data. <br>
4. Evaluate the model and perform hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal tree.
